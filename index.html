    <h1>Hi :)</h1>
    <p>this is just a placeholder for my portfolio, i felt like the one i had up didnt reflect me anymore</p>
    <p>i am working on a new one, progress is slow as im still trying to figure out what i want to do</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>im getting back into coding as i took a break due to burnout</p>
    <p>during my break i found myself having aspirations to do something bigger with my coding skills, not just work on small web projects that no ones gonna view</p>
    <p>so coming back im trying to work on bigger stuff (ignore my first project) and sharpen my skills and make something im proud of and want to share with the world</p>
    <p>with that being said heres all my projects since my return, right now its just small things i wanted to code before i try something big again:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/listening-history.html">Stalk Josh's Listening History</a> - Added 3/9/25</li>
    </ul>
    <p>if you are interested in my older projects you can check them out on <a href="https://github.com/i-suck-at-most-stuff">my github</a></p>

    <p>- josh \(^w^)/</p>
